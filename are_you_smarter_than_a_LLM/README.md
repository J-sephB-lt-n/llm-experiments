# Are You Smarter Than a Large Language Model?

I've compiled a series of tasks here which I think are of business relevance to a large number of different businesses. Some of the tasks are very easy for a large language model, and others are tasks on which current state-of-the-art models are known to struggle. 

For each task, I show my own solution, as well as 1 or more solutions by an unsupervised large language model (I have used Open-AI's GPT4). For each task, I've also included the code which I used to generate the task (if I used code to generate any part of the task), the code which I used to prompt the language model, and any other details which I think you may find interesting.

I encourage you to solve these problems yourself, and compare your speed and aptitude against the language model. For reference, the language model never took longer than 15 seconds to provide a solution (although the model's solution was not always correct). 

I hope that this gives you some insight into what large language models are capable (and incapable) of.

Here are links to specific tasks:

| Task | Description
|------|-----------------------------
| [Time Series Forecasting and Analysis](#time-series-forecasting-and-analysis-task) | Identify patterns in monthly sales data 
| [Item Triage](#item-triage-task) | Prioritize customer queries according to urgency 
| [Question Answering from a Knowledge Base](#question-answering-from-a-knowledge-base) | TODO
| [Text Summarisation](#text-summarisation-task) | TODO
| [Optimisation (Knapsack problem)](#optimisation-task-knapsack-problem) | Decide which items to pack into a container in order to maximise profit 

## Time Series Forecasting and Analysis Task

Please complete the following tasks:

1. Describe any predictable patterns which you observe in this data (e.g. trend).

2. Provide predictions (forecasted sales) for the last 3 months of 2027.

## Item Triage Task  

The following table reports 40 recent customer queries to a web-based banking platform. These queries need to be prioritized according to customer risk (i.e. most urgent are processed first). 

Please mark each customer query as "yes", "mabye" or "no", where:

| Classification | Meaning 
|----------------|----------
| Yes            | The customer has almost certainly lost money as a result of fraudulent transactions
| Maybe          | There is a possibility that the customer has lost money as a result of fraudulent transactions 
| No             | The customer has almost certainly not lost any money due to fraud

I generated the customer queries using the OpenAi GPT4 model, with the following prompt:
<br><br>

*"Please generate 10 authentic customer queries that were submitted to the 'customer support' service of a web-based banking application. Each query should be between 5 and 50 words long. The customer queries must all be related to {topic}."*

I ran this prompt separately for each of these topics:

* {payments with suspicious attributes}
* {difficulty with the user interface (they don't know how to use the platform)}
* {absolutely normal banking activity (i.e. nothing fraudulent), but containing the word 'fraud'}

## Optimisation Task (Knapsack problem)

Please decide which combination of the following 8 items to pack into a sack which can hold up to 30kg total weight, maximising the sum of the total item values in the sack:

| ItemID  | Item Weight (kg) | Item Value |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| 1       | 2                | 30         |
| 2       | 4                | 10         |
| 3       | 6                | 50         |
| 4       | 8                | 10         |
| 5       | 10               | 60         |
| 6       | 12               | 20         |
| 7       | 14               | 80         |
| 8       | 18               | 50         |

(note that these item attributes were generated by ChatGPT3.5 using the following prompt: "Can you please generate an example knapsack problem for me please? One in there is one knapsack and 8 possible items to pack.")

In case this generated problem is very similar to an example appearing in ChatGPT3.5's training data (which might give a GPT model an unfair advantage in answering the question), after getting ChatGPT3.5's response I changed the order of rows and columns in the table, renamed the columns, divided each item value by 3 and doubled each item weight.

I evaluated candidate solutions {1,2,3,4,5}, {1,3,5,6} and {3,5,7}, from which the best was {3,5,7} (with a total value of 190).

I confirmed that this is the correct solution using google's [ortools](https://github.com/google/or-tools) (see my python code [here](./tasks/knapsack_problem/code/explicit_solution.py))
