# Are You Smarter Than a Large Language Model?

I've compiled a series of tasks here which I think are of business relevance to a large number of different businesses. Some of the tasks are very easy for a large language model, and others are cases on which current state-of-the-art models are known to struggle. 

For each task, I show my own solution, as well as 1 or more solutions by an unsupervised large language model (I have used Open-AI's GPT4). For each task, I've also included the code which I used to generate the task (if I used code for that task), and the code which I used to prompt the language model.

I encourage you to solve these problems yourself, and compare your speed and aptitude against the language model. For reference, the language model never took longer than TODO seconds to provide a solution. 

I hope that this gives you some insight into what large language models are capable (and incapable) of.

## Question Answering from a Knowledge Base

Using [this knowledge base](./tasks/knowledge_base_question_answering/assets/knowledge_base.txt), answer the following customer question:

"TODO"

<br>

<details>
  <summary>More details about this task</summary>
I generated the customer queries using the OpenAi GPT4 model, with the following prompt:
<br><br>

*"Please generate 10 authentic customer queries that were submitted to the 'customer support' service of a web-based banking application. Each query should be between 5 and 50 words long. The customer queries must all be related to {topic}."*

I ran this prompt separately for each of these topics:

* {payments with suspicious attributes}
* {difficulty with the user interface (they don't know how to use the platform)}
* {absolutely normal banking activity (i.e. nothing fraudulent), but containing the word 'fraud'}

* {money stolen from their account} 
* {authentication and access}
* {the customer not being able to pay for something}
* {debit orders which the customer authorised but is surprised when the money comes out because they don't understand what a debit order is}

You can see my python code [here](./tasks/item_triage/code/simulate_customer_queries.py)

## Time Series Forecasting and Analysis Task

Inspect the following plot of monthly sales (in millions) and answer the questions which follow: 
<figure>
  <img src="./tasks/univariate_forecasting/assets/data_plot.png" height="400" />
  <figcaption>(The code which made this plot was entirely generated by ChatGPT3.5)</figcaption>
</figure>

Please complete the following tasks:

1. Describe any predictable patterns which you observe in this data (e.g. trend).

2. Provide predictions (forecasted sales) for the last 3 months of 2027.

--Question 1--

* Ignoring data noise, there is clear growth in sales over time i.e. 2027 > 2026 > 2025.    

* There is clear seasonal trend within each year: explainTODO 

--Question 2--

* 2027-10: 

* 2027-11:

## Optimisation Task (Knapsack problem)

Please decide which combination of the following 8 items to pack into a sack which can hold up to 30kg total weight, maximising the sum of the total item values in the sack:

| ItemID  | Item Weight (kg) | Item Value |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| 1       | 2                | 30         |
| 2       | 4                | 10         |
| 3       | 6                | 50         |
| 4       | 8                | 10         |
| 5       | 10               | 60         |
| 6       | 12               | 20         |
| 7       | 14               | 80         |
| 8       | 18               | 50         |

(note that these item attributes were generated by ChatGPT3.5 using the following prompt: "Can you please generate an example knapsack problem for me please? One in there is one knapsack and 8 possible items to pack.")

In case this generated problem is very similar to an example appearing in ChatGPT3.5's training data (which might give a GPT model an unfair advantage in answering the question), after getting ChatGPT3.5's response I changed the order of rows and columns in the table, renamed the columns, divided each item value by 3 and doubled each item weight.

I evaluated candidate solutions {1,2,3,4,5}, {1,3,5,6} and {3,5,7}, from which the best was {3,5,7} (with a total value of 190).

I confirmed that this is the correct solution using google's [ortools](https://github.com/google/or-tools) (see my python code [here](./tasks/knapsack_problem/code/explicit_solution.py))
