Please complete the following tasks:

1. Describe any predictable patterns which you observe in this data (e.g. trend).

2. Provide predictions (forecasted sales) for the last 3 months of 2027.

--Question 1--

* Ignoring data noise, there is clear growth in sales over time i.e. 2027 > 2026 > 2025.    

* There is clear seasonal trend within each year: explainTODO 

--Question 2--

* 2027-10:

Here is my python code:

* [plot_data.py](./tasks/univariate_forecasting/code/plot_data.py) (this code was 100% generated by ChatGPT3.5)

* [simulate_data.py](./tasks/univariate_forecasting/code/simulate_data.py) 

## Optimisation Task (Knapsack problem)

Please decide which combination of the following 8 items to pack into a sack which can hold up to 30kg total weight, maximising the sum of the total item values in the sack:

| ItemID  | Item Weight (kg) | Item Value |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| 1       | 2                | 30         |
| 2       | 4                | 10         |
| 3       | 6                | 50         |
| 4       | 8                | 10         |
| 5       | 10               | 60         |
| 6       | 12               | 20         |
| 7       | 14               | 80         |
| 8       | 18               | 50         |

(note that these item attributes were generated by ChatGPT3.5 using the following prompt: "Can you please generate an example knapsack problem for me please? One in there is one knapsack and 8 possible items to pack.")

In case this generated problem is very similar to an example appearing in ChatGPT3.5's training data (which might give a GPT model an unfair advantage in answering the question), after getting ChatGPT3.5's response I changed the order of rows and columns in the table, renamed the columns, divided each item value by 3 and doubled each item weight.

I evaluated candidate solutions {1,2,3,4,5}, {1,3,5,6} and {3,5,7}, from which the best was {3,5,7} (with a total value of 190).

I confirmed that this is the correct solution using google's [ortools](https://github.com/google/or-tools) (see my python code [here](./tasks/knapsack_problem/code/explicit_solution.py))
