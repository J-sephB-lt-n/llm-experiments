# Generative Fiction: Enforce Elements of Good Fiction

The aims of this project:

* To generate diverse and high quality short stories using a small locally-hosted language model

* To allow the reader to dictate the direction/content of the story, in a small or large way, if they wish to 

* To maintain narrative cohesion and story stability through explicit maintaining of state (locations, characters, etc.)

* To create high quality and engaging stories through explicit use of story elements (character, plot, conflict etc.)
